0               # integer; number of fixed airfoils (0 if the first airfoil can rotate, n if the first airfoil is fixed
                  and there are n-1 airfoils directly attached to it using fixed-type hinges)
2               # integer; number of connected airfoils
9.81, 0            # float, float; gravity strength, cc angle relative to negative y-axis (usual=negative angle of attack)

## Airfoil and hinge specifications ##
    # Specify as many airfoils as indicated above, each in a separate line, preceded by a line with hinge specifications
    # Hinge lines should have the format: type (pin | spring | damped | fixed, spring_damped), characteristic_value
      (None | springconstant | damping coeff. | angle | spring constant), initial_angle, rest_angle (only if type=spring
      or spring_damped, def. as theta_2-theta_1) | damping_coefficient (only if type=spring_damped)
    # Airfoil lines should have the format: profile_name, chord_length, x_left_hinge, y_left_hinge, x_right_hinge,
      y_right_hinge, x_cm, y_cm, mass, moment_of_inertia
